const Intro = () => ( <StyledIntro>The Hong Kong Vanities project is a poetic exploration of Hong Kong. Vanity plates are the ultimate nonessential car accessory for owners who want to highlight their status, wealth, humour, desires, beliefs or superstitions. This gave me the idea of creating a new style of poetry â€“ using images of the thousands of vanity plates in Hong Kong, I reached out to poets and encouraged them to mix and match the plates into their own unique poems. The project consists of a huge collection of vanity plate images, a gallery of poems by Hong Kong-based and international artists, and a poetry game enabling people to compose and share their own Hong Kong vanity poems.</StyledIntro>)

  //<StyledIntro>Hong Kong's vanity plates, better known locally as personalized vehicle registration marks (PVRM), are auctioned at the starting price of HK$ 5000. The poems on these platform are the result of the combination of the car plates. An archive of hundreds of pictures will inspire poems and rhymes. The poems will be shown on Instagram in an exhibition with a live performance.</StyledIntro>
